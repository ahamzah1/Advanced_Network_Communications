# Advanced Internet Communication  

## Course Overview  
The **Advanced Internet Communication** course explores modern networking concepts, protocols, and tools essential for understanding and analyzing internet communication. This course covers both theoretical foundations and hands-on practical experience with real-world networking applications.  
This repo is made to hold the contents of the labs solved.

## Topics Covered  

### 1. **Networking Protocols**  
- **TCP/IP & UDP** – Understanding connection-oriented vs. connectionless communication.  
- **HTTP/HTTPS** – Web communication protocols and secure data transfer.  
- **DNS & DHCP** – Resolving domain names and dynamic IP addressing.  
- **ICMP & ARP** – Network diagnostics and address resolution.  

### 2. **Network Traffic Analysis**  
- **Wireshark** – Capturing and analyzing network packets.  
- **Packet Inspection** – Identifying different network layers and protocols.  
- **Traffic Filtering** – Applying filters to focus on specific packets.  

### 3. **Network Security & Scanning**  
- **Nmap** – Network discovery and security auditing.  
- **Port Scanning** – Identifying open ports and running services.  
- **Vulnerability Assessment** – Detecting potential weaknesses in a network.  

### 4. **Advanced Communication Techniques**  
- **WebSockets** – Enabling real-time, bidirectional communication over the web.  
- **QUIC Protocol** – Google's next-gen transport protocol for faster internet communication.  
- **VPN & Proxy Servers** – Securing internet traffic and anonymity.  

### 5. **Hands-On Labs & Practical Applications**
